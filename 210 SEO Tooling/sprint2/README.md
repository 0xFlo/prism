# Sprint 2: Stabilise Testing & Performance Harness

**Goal**: Finish the dashboard migration work by aligning automated coverage with the new context-based architecture and re-introduce a sustainable performance benchmarking harness.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Review**: Open [sprint-board.md](./sprint-board.md) for status, risks, and dependencies.
2. **Plan**: Work tickets in priority order (#013 → #015).
3. **Execute**: Keep commits small; update tickets as tasks progress.
4. **Validate**: Run targeted test suites (see each ticket) before marking done.

## Focus Areas

- Align LiveView integration coverage with the post-refactor UI semantics.
- Rebuild the `DashboardLivePerformanceTest` harness as an opt-in suite with manageable fixtures.
- Capture the new architecture/testing process in project docs so future contributors know how to run the new suites.
