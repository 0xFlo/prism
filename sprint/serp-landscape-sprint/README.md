# SERP Landscape Sprint Tickets

This folder tracks the implementation tickets for the SERP Landscape Intelligence sprint. Each ticket links back to the main RFC (`sprint/SERP_LANDSCAPE_SPRINT.md`) and the supporting TECHNICAL_SPEC / IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER docs. Files follow the `ticket-###-title.md` pattern; update their status as we execute work.
